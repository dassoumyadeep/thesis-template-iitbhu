## Building your thesis

### Using an IDE (such as TexStudio/TexMaker)

When starting a new session, compile and run (order specified below) `thesis-template.tex` first. After this, running/building any of the individual tex files you are currently working would render the complete document.

Set the following build order on your IDE for the desired results.

    pdflatex
    bibtex
    pdflatex
    pdflatex
    view-pdf-internal

Confused on what to use? [This](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/339/latex-editors-ideshttps://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/339/latex-editors-ides) may help!

### Online, using Overleaf, ShareLatex, or Authorea

Set `thesis-template.tex` as the primary document and compile.

### Using command line interface (Unix/Linux/Windows)

*Work under progress, will be updated soon.*

Thesis information such as title, author, year, degree, etc., and other meta-data can be modified in `thesis-info.tex`

### Class <a name="class"></a>

The class file, `PhDThesisPSnPDF`, is based on the standard `book` class.
It supports the following custom options in the documentclass in `thesis-template.tex`:

(Usage `\documentclass[a4paper,12pt,times,twoside]{PhDThesisPSnPDF}`)

*   `a4paper` (default as per the University guidelines) or `a5paper`: Paper size

*   `12pt`,`times`: The institute guidelines require using Times New Roman with font size of 12 pt. This template also supports `10pt` and `11pt`.

*   `oneside` or `twoside` (default): This is especially useful for printing double side (twoside) or single side. Leaving this blank would yield double-sided page-layout.

*   `print`: Supports Print and Online Version with different page margins and hyperlink styles.
    Use `print` in the options to activate Print Version with appropriate margins and page layout and view styles.
    Leaving the options field blank will activate Online version.

*   `custommargin`: You can alter the margin dimension for both print and online version by using the keyword `custommargin` in the options. Then you can define the dimensions of the margin in the `preamble.tex` file:

        \ifsetCustomMargin
          \RequirePackage[left=37mm,right=30mm,top=35mm,bottom=30mm]{geometry}
          \setFancyHdr
        \fi
    `\setFancyHdr` should be called when using custom margins for proper header/footer dimensions

    `\ifsetMargin` is deprecated, please use `\ifsetCustomMargin` instead.

*   `index`: Including this option builds the index, which is placed at the end of the thesis.

    Instructions on how to use the index can be found [here](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing#Using_makeidx).

    _Note_: the package `makeidx` is used to create the index.

*   `chapter`: This option enables only the specified chapter and it's references. Useful for review and corrections.

*   `draft`: The default draft mode supports some special features such as line numbers, images, and water mark with
    timestamp and custom text. Position of the text can be modified in `preamble.tex`.

*   `draftclassic`: This mode is similar to the default draft mode in the book class. Images are not loaded.

*   `lineno`: Enables pagewise line numbering on the outer edge. You can switch-off line numbering by specifying `nolineno` in the options.

<!--- `flushleft`: The University recommends using ragged right or flush left alignment for texts. The reason behind this is left justifying a text may exclude a certain readers. Dyslexic people find it hard to read justified text. You can enable `raggedright` option in the document class by passing `flushleft` argument. Default is flush left and right.
-->
### Title page <a name="title"></a>

Page 14 of the [Revised Specification and Information Regarding the Preparation of Thesis](https://repo.iitbhu.ac.in/db/2016/ir-2016-390/Specification%20and%20information%20regarding%20the%20preparation%20of%20thesis.pdf) specifies the title-page format.

* The front page (title page) resizes to fit your title length. You can modify the options in `Titlepage/titlepage.tex`.

* Edit the degree as per your requirements.

* By default, the name and designation of the guide(s) does not appear on the titlepage. Please add the same suitably if needed.

### Certificate, declaration and copyright transfer <a name="certificate"></a>

The institute guidelines require a certificate, declaration, dedication, and copyright transfer to be included in the thesis prelimnaries. Each of these are defined in separate tex files in the `Certficates` directory.

* `certificate.tex` and `dedication.tex` use tabular environments to list supervisor(s). To add or remove supervisors, add or drop columns from the table, keeping in mind the spacings that have been hard-coded.

* For PhD thesis, uncomment the line mentioning Comprehensive Examination, Candidacy and SOTA in `certificate.tex`.

### Abstract and abstract-standalone <a name="abstract"></a>

Both the thesis-template and the standalone document derive the abstract from `Abstract/abstract-text.tex`. Editing this only will be sufficient.

* A separate abstract with the title of the thesis, the candidate name, and the name of the guiding professor has to be submitted to the Academic Office along with the soft-bound copy of the thesis.

* This can be generated by separately editing and building `Abstract-standalone/abstract-standalone.tex` file.

*(`abstract-standalone.tex` is an independant tex file, and will soon be incorporated into the main template.)*

### Adding and Editing Chapters <a name="chapter"></a>
This template uses separate tex files for separate chapters. Three sample chapters are provided for illustrative purposes.

* To add a new chapter, create a corresponding tex file (say `Chapter4/chapter4.tex`), and add an entry under section `mainmatter` of `thesis-template.tex`.

        \mainmatter
            \include{Chapter4/chapter4}    % New Chapter

* Figures corresponding to each chapter should be stored in the `Figs` folder inside the chapter directory. One can create separate `vector` and `raster` folders for corresponding graphic files inside the `Figs` folder, or simply drop the graphic files in the `Figs` folder.
  *Examples can be found in chapter 2 of the template.*

* It is possible to add bibliography separately for each chapter. Just put the corresponding `.bib` file in the chapter directory, and specify bibliography options in the chapter tex file.

*  The chapter mode allows user to only print specific chapters along with references. By default, it excludes everything else in the front matter and appendices. This can done by using `chapter` option in the document class in `thesis.tex`. Ignore subsequent warnings about skipping sections (if any).

*  To generate the separate abstract and the title page, make sure the following commands are in the preamble section of `thesis.tex` file:

		\ifdefineChapter
			\includeonly{Chapter3/chapter3}
		\fi

### Using the draft mode <a name="draft"></a>

`draft` adds a watermark `draft` text with timestamp and version number at the top or
the bottom of the page. Pagewise line numbering is added on every page. `draft` settings can be tweaked in the `preamble.tex`.

* Use `draftclassic` in the document class options to use the default book class draft mode.

* To add figures in draft mode (default enabled), in the preamble set `\setkeys{Gin}{draft=false}`. `draft=true` disables figures

* To change the watermark text
      \SetDraftText{DRAFT}

* To change the position of the watermark text. Default watermark position is top. The location can be changed to (top / bottom)
      \SetDraftWMPosition{bottom}

* To change the draft version. Default draft version is v1.0.
      \SetDraftVersion{v1.1}

* Watermark grayscale value can be modified. Text grayscale value (should be between 0-black and 1-white). Default value is 0.75
      \SetDraftGrayScale{0.8}

### Choosing the bibliography style <a name="bib"></a>

  `PhDThesisPSnPDF` currently supports two styles `authoryear` and `numbered (default)`. Citation style has to be set. You can also specify `custombib` style and customise the bibliography.

  * `authoryear`: For author-year citation eg., Krishna (2013)

  * `numbered`: (Default Option) For numbered and sorted citation e.g., [1,5,2]

  * `custombib`: Define your own bibliography style in the `preamble.tex` file.

  		\RequirePackage[square, sort, numbers, authoryear]{natbib}

  * If you would like to use biblatex instead of natbib. Pass the option `custombib` in the documentclass. In the `preamble.tex` file, edit the custombib section. Make sure you don't load the natbib package and you can specify the layout of your references in `thesis.tex` in the reference section. If you are using `biber` as backend, run `pdflatex thesis.tex >> biber thesis >> pdflatex thesis.tex >> biber thesis >> pdflatex thesis.tex`. If you are using the default natbib package, don't worry about this.

   (*Have a look at various [Natbib](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Natbib_bibliography_styles) and [Biblatex](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Biblatex_bibliography_styles) based bibliography styles.*)


### Choosing the fonts <a name="font"></a>

`PhDThesisPSnPDF` currently supports three fonts `Times`, `Fourier` and `Latin Modern (default)`.

*   `times`: (Institute guidelines require using Times). Specifying times option in the document class will use `mathptpx` or `Times` font with Math Support.
*   `fourier`: fourier font with math support
*   `default (empty)`: When no font is specified, `Latin Modern` is used as the default font with Math Support.
*   `customfont`: Any custom font can be set in preamble by using `customfont` option in the document class. Then the custom font can be loaded in preamble.tex in the line:

		\ifsetCustomFont
		  \RequirePackage{Your_Custom_Font}
		\fi

* To use a system font (open type) font with XeLaTeX, please select `customfont` option in the `documentclass` in `thesis.tex`. Add the path and font name to the custom font definition in `preamble.tex`

    \ifsetCustomFont
      \setmainfont[
        Path              = ./libertine/opentype/,
        Extension         = .otf,
        UprightFont = LinLibertine_R,
        BoldFont = LinLibertine_RZ, % Regular Semibold
        ItalicFont = LinLibertine_RI,
        BoldItalicFont = LinLibertine_RZI, % Regular Semibold Italic
      ] {libertine}
      \newfontfamily\libertinesystemfont{Linux Libertine O}
      \fi

    Please use XeLaTeX tool chain with LaTeXmk.

### Choosing the page style <a name="page"></a>

`PhDThesisPSnPDF` defines 3 different page styles (header and footer). The following definition is for `twoside` layout. To choose a page style, include it in the `documentclass` options: `\documentclass[PageStyleI]{PhDThesisPSnPDF}`. Alternatively, page style can be changed by adding `\pagestyle{PageStyleI}` or `\pagestyle{PageStyleII}` in `thesis.tex`. Note: Using `\pagestyle` command will override `documentclass` options when used globally.

* `default (leave empty)`: For Page Numbers in Header (Left Even, Right Odd) and Chapter Name in Header (Right Even) and Section #. Section Name (Left Odd). Blank Footer.

        Header (Even)   : 4                                                 Introduction

        Header (Odd)    : 1.2 Section Name 		   			                5

        Footer 		    : Empty

* `PageStyleI`: For Page Numbers in Header (Left Even, Right Odd) and Chapter Name next to the Page Number on Even Side (Left Even). Section Number and Section Name and Page Number in Header on Odd Side (Right Odd). Footer is empty. Layout:

        Header (Even)   : 4 | Introduction

        Header (Odd)    :                         			                1.2 Section Name | 5

        Footer 		    :                               Empty

* `PageStyleII`: Chapter Name on Even Side (Left Even) in Header. Section Number and Section Name in Header on Odd Side (Right Odd). Page numbering in footer. Layout:

        Header (Even)   : Introduction

        Header (Odd)    : 			   				                        1.2 Section Name

        Footer[centered]:                           	3

### Changing the visual style of chapter headings <a name="headings"></a>

The visual style of chapter headings can be modified using the `titlesec` package. Edit the following lines in the `preamble.tex` file.

        \RequirePackage{titlesec}
        \newcommand{\PreContentTitleFormat}{\titleformat{\chapter}[display]{\scshape\Large}
        {\Large\filleft{\chaptertitlename} \Huge\thechapter}
        {1ex}{}
        [\vspace{1ex}\titlerule]}
        \newcommand{\ContentTitleFormat}{\titleformat{\chapter}[display]{\scshape\huge}
        {\Large\filleft{\chaptertitlename} \Huge\thechapter}{1ex}
        {\titlerule\vspace{1ex}\filright}
        [\vspace{1ex}\titlerule]}
        \newcommand{\PostContentTitleFormat}{\PreContentTitleFormat}
        \PreContentTitleFormat

### Custom settings <a name="custom"></a>

*   The depth for the table of contents can be set using:

		\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
		\setcounter{tocdepth}{3}
    A depth of [3] indicates to a level of `\subsubsection` or #.#.#.#. Default set as 2.

*   To hide sections from appearing in TOC use: `\tochide\section{Section name}` in your TeX files

*   Define custom caption style for figure and table caption in `preamble.tex` using:

        \RequirePackage[small,bf,figurename=Fig.,labelsep=space,tableposition=top]{caption}

*   Uncomment the following lines in `preamble.tex` to force a figure to be displayed in a particular location. Use `H` when including graphics. Note `H` instead of `h`.

		\usepackage{float}
		\restylefloat{figure}

*   Bibliography with Author-Year Citation in `preamble.tex`:

        \RequirePackage[round, sort, numbers, authoryear]{natbib}

*   Line spacing for the entire document can be specified in `preamble.tex`. Uncomment the line spacing you prefer. e.g.,
		\onehalfspacing

### Nomenclature definition <a name="nom"></a>

* To use nomenclature in your chapters:

        \nomenclature[g-pi]{$\pi$}{ $\simeq 3.14\ldots$}

    The sort keys have prefix. In this case a prefix of `g` is used to denote Greek Symbols, followed by `-pi` or `-sort_key`. Use a `-` to separate sort key from the prefixes. The standard prefixes defined in this class are:

    * `A` or `a`: Roman Symbols

    * `G` or `g`: Greek Symbols

    * `Z` or `z`: Acronyms/Abbreviations

    * `R` or `r`: Superscripts

    * `S` or `s`: Subscripts

    * `X` or `x`: Other Symbols

*   You can change the Title of Nomenclature to Notations or Symbols in the `preamble.tex` using:

        \renewcommand\nomname{Symbols}

 TexStudio's default compile option doesn't include `nomenclature`, to compile your document with the nomenclature, do the following:

		Options >> Configure TexStudio >> Build >> User Commands >> add user command
In `add user command` type `makenomeclature:makenomenclature` on the left pane and `makeindex %.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o %.nls` on the execution side. Now you can run the user defined command `makenomenclature` from `Tools >> User >> makenomenclature`.

<!---Alternatively, you can use the `compile-thesis-windows.bat` file or run `make` on Unix / Linux / MacOS-->

## To-do Notes <a name="todo"></a>

To include custom to-do notes in your pdf document use  `\mynote{Hey! I have a note}` anywhere in your chapters. To activate this feature, you need to uncomment the following lines in `preamble.tex`. To-do notes will be available only in the `draft` or `draftclassic` and not in the final thesis.

	\ifsetDraft
		\usepackage[colorinlistoftodos]{todonotes}
			\newcommand{\mynote}[1]
			{\todo[author=kks32,size=\small,inline,color=green!40]{#1}}
	\else
		\newcommand{\mynote}[1]{}
		\newcommand{\listoftodos}{}
	\fi

<!---
## Git hooks

You rarely want to commit changes to your TeX files which are not reflected in the PDF included in the repo.
You can automate this process, among other things, with a git hook.
Install the hook with `make hooks` (or see how to do it in `./hooks/install.sh`).
Now every time you commit, if any files affecting your build have changed in this commit
and those changes are more recent than the last modification of `thesis.pdf`,
the default `make` target will be run and changes to `thesis.pdf` will be `git add`ed.

Currently, changes to any tex/pdf/eps/png/cls files are picked up.
This can be changed in `./hooks/pre-commit`.

Skip the hook with `git commit --no-verify`.

`bash`-only.

## General guidelines from the original author <a name="gen"></a>
[Why is it important to follow good practices and not get killed by a Velociraptor ;)](http://www.xkcd.com/292/)

*   To restrict the length of the figure caption in List of figures use a \[short-title\] and {longtitle} for the caption or the section:

		`\caption[Caption that you want to appear in TOC]{Actual caption of the figure}`
		`\section[short]{title}`

*   To exclude sections from being numbered and disable it from appearing in the Table of Contents use \section*{Section_Name} or \chapter*{Chapter_Name}

*   To only exclude it from being listed in the Table of Contents encapsulate the section command inside the `\tochide` command. `\tochide{\section{Section_Name}}` the section will not appear in the Table of Contents, but the section will be numbered.

*   When including figures in your tex file, it's a good practice to size your picture depending on the page size, instead of using absolute values. In the following example `0.75\textwidth` refers to picture width being set to 75% of the text width.

        \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{minion}

*   Use a `-` to separate sort key from the prefixes, eg., `g-pi` denotes the Greek symbol `pi`.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Troubleshooting warnings

#### _W1_:I get the package Fancyhdr Warning: \fancyhead's `E` option without twoside option is useless on input line \# or \#. What should I do?

Nothing. The warning is because the twoside option is also defined in the class, although only the oneside option is currently used.

#### _W2_: I get the Class PhDThesisPSnPDF Warning: Unknown or non-standard option 'something'. Will see if I can load it from the book class. If you get a warning unused global option(s): `something` then the option is not supported! on input line \#.

You are either trying to use a undefined option or a non-standard option which is in the book class but not defined in the PhD Thesis Template. If it can be used it will be loaded and you will get no further warnings. If not, the option you chose is unavailable.


#### _W3_: I get LaTeX Warning: Unused global option(s):[something].

You are trying to load an option that is not supported in the PhDThesisClass and the Book Class. Are you sure you are using the right option? Check your spelling!

#### _W4_: I get I'm skipping whatever remains of this command line \# of file thesis.aux \@input{Chapter1/chapter1.aux}

If you are generating a separate abstract for your thesis submission, ignore this warning and good luck with your submission. If you are compiling your thesis and see this warning, please remove the option `abstract` from the document class.

#### _W5_: I get blank pages between chapters

This is normal for a book class. Usually, a new chapter in a book always starts on the right hand side, which is why you see a blank page. You can remove the extra blank page by passing `openany` option to the documentclass. This works for double sided printing. However, if you are printing on a single side, please pass `oneside` option to the document class.

#### _W6_: My references aren't listed in the ordered in which I cite them

This is controlled by the bibliography style. Please use `\bibliographystyle{unsrt}` in `thesis.tex` instead of `apalike`. This applicable only for numerically sorted references.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issue(s) / Bugs / Feature requests in the original template

*   Hyperlinks doesn't seem to be working in Post-Script file, however works on DVI and PDF (which is produced from the PS file), possibly viewer limitation than a code bug.

*   On older versions of dvips (version 5.97 or below), if your page margins do not appear properly in your PDF, when compiling through DVI >> PS >> PDF, please ensure that you have set a4paper or a5paper in the document class. If you are still having issues you can run:

		ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=a4 thesis.ps thesis.pdf

    This issue occurs only when the papersize is not specified in the document class and you are compiling DVI >> PS >> PDF using an older version (5.97 or below) of dvips.

*   Open issues in the original template can be tracked at [https://github.com/kks32/phd-thesis-template/issues](https://github.com/kks32/phd-thesis-template/issues). If you would like a new feature to be added to the template, please create an issue and label it as an enhancement.
